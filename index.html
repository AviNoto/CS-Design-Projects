      <div class="box">For this project, I made a football game where you choose what color uniform the defender wears and then the referee goes in between the players and the sky is either light or dark. There are also lights coming from the fans that are in different places every time.</div>

      <div class="box">For this project, I made a playable game inspired by crossy road but very different. You are the hawk trying to avoid the chicken using the arrow keys and collect cars using by clicking. You get one point for clicking on a car and lose two when you collide with the chicken and if you have less than zero points, you lose and the game ends.</div>

      <div class="box">For this project, I tracked my sleep and other data to see if how much sleep I got affected how tired I still was in the morning. I filled out a Google Form every day for about 4 weeks and created a YouTube video to talk about my findings.</div>

      <div class="box">For this project, I made a website using Observable and made it so you can change the background color and change the number of servings which will update the amounts in the recipe.</div>
